Controller board itself does not have any identifiable model or part number. It might be custom-made for Chevrolet. It has the following connectors:
- 50-pin ribbon connector to the display module
- 4-pin ribbon connector to the touch module
- 4-pin plug connector to display's LCD backlight
- 8-pin plug connector (P17 X1 connector) to the main radio unit and the rest of the vehicle

### GVIF Connector

The blue connector on the display controller is for Gigabit Video Interface (GVIF). GVIF transmits video data over a single shielded twisted pair using [FPD-Link II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPD-Link#FPD-Link_II) protocol which uses low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS). GVIF connector has 3 pins, but the connector shape might be unique to a specific display controller, vehicle model or series.

*I was not able to find GVIF connectors on sale on any OEM site or eBay*
*Although, GM might use the same connector as Toyota. GVIF connector for Land Rover that I purchased does not fit properly.*

### GVIF Video Decoder Chip

Smaller chip on the display controller board next to the GVIF connector is CXB1466R video decoder chip. It converts FPDLink-II signal sent over GVIF to parallel 24-bit RGB signal. *(interestingly, LCD display interface is only 18 bits)*

[Datasheet for decoder CXB1456R (sister chip)](./CXB1456R.pdf)

*AFAIK, the complementary encoder chip is CXB1465R.*

[Datasheet for encoder CXB1455R (sister chip)](./CXB1455R.pdf)

*GVIF and CXB\* encoder/decoder chips are developed by Sony and there is not much information about them in the open. I was unable to get the datasheet for CXB1466R or CXB1465, but there are datasheet for sister chips CXB1455 and CXB1456.*

*Additionally, CXB\* chips are difficult to find online*

### CAN Graphical Interface (CGI) Circuit Description

(from Chevy Volt's service manual)

This bus is used by the Entertainment sub-system to transfer high-rate display graphics between the Radio and the Info Display Module and/or Radio/HVAC Control. The electrical characteristics of the CAN Graphical Interface (CGI) Bus are very similar to the High Speed GMLAN Bus. The message strategy and construction of messages are different however. Sometimes communication is required between the CAN Graphical Interface Bus and the Low Speed GMLAN Bus. This is accomplished by using the Radio SilverBox as the Gateway module. Since the CAN Graphical Interface Bus and primary High Speed GMLAN Bus have similar electrical characteristics, the diagnostics for each are similar.

A bus wake up signal will be generated by the Radio or by the Info Display Module when the system functionality is required. The communication function of the CAN Graphical Interface shall be enabled or disabled based on the voltage level of the Centre Stack Wake. The network will stay awake as long as the circuit voltage is driven low, to less than 1.5 V. Communications are disabled with a high circuit voltage around 5.0 V.

The Radio can execute a warm reset of the Info Display Module if the Info Display Module fails to respond to the Radio's request. The Centre Stack Reset is a low-asserted pull down output (less than 1.5 V) from the Radio to the Info Display Module and has the same electrical characteristics as those for the Centre Stack Wake signal defined above.

### Display Driver Chip

This does not seem relevant, but this is the CPU on the display controller.

# Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi is an obvious candidate for an in-car computer. Broadcom SoC can natively output parallel 18-bit video.

## Display Parallel Interface

[Source](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#parallel-display-interface-dpi)

Display Parallel Interface (DPI) is an up-to-24-bit parallel RGB interface controlled by GPU firmware and available on all Raspberry Pi boards through GPIO pins.

Pins marked as DPI_D* can be configured to output data different modes:
- 565 (5 bits for red and blue, 6 bits for green)
- 666 (6 bits for each color - 18-bit mode)
- 888 (8 bits for each color - full 24-bit mode)

Since the LCD display is expecting 18 bits of color data, use mode 5 (6 bits per color, in order of blue-green-red)

## Software

[Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit)

[LineageOS](https://konstakang.com/devices/rpi4/LineageOS18/) would be great to use Android apps (particularly, OsmAnd and Spotify), but there might be issues with video output (need to test)

# Switching The Input

Switch the LCD 50-pin and touchscreen 4-pin ribbon connectors between 2 inputs (display controller and Raspberry Pi) using an old school switch box.

After looking at the datasheet for the LCD, due to specific voltage levels involved and a startup sequence, it might be a better idea to only switch the clock, sync and data pins. This means only 21 pins (DCLK, HSYNC, VSYNC, 18 bits of color) need to be switched for the LCD. Ground has to be shared between Raspberry Pi and the LCD controller. *Hopefully ground pins are the same level even when powering Raspberry Pi*

Another idea was to encode video signal as FPDLink II and switch GVIF connector digitally. Considering how difficult it is to find a GVIF connector and an encoder chip (and I would like to avoid soldering to the controller board directly), I decided against this option.
